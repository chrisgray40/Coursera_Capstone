They are interested in learning more about the determinants of major incidents in order to identify which underlying characteristics are most likely to result in severe injuries or fatalities. Some of these factors are likely to be due to driver behaviors, while others will be due to underlying environmental factors. The city planners are interested in using their power to change roadways to be safer for motorists, as well as discouraging dangerous behaviors. With any luck, the analysis will lead to many lives saved in Seattle and beyond."
